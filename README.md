## Overview

This repository contains a bond fluctuation model of a semiflexible polymer chain in confinement. The current experiments consider confinement to a cylindrical surface. 

The dynamics of the polymer are simulated by assigning an energy based on the bending of the polymer, and running the Metropolis algorithm.
